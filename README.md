# Dungeon Blockout ‚Äî Intro to Level Design (A02)

A gray-boxed dungeon built for **Intro to Level Design ‚Äì Fall 2025**.  
Although the assignment‚Äôs focus was strictly *block-out*, I experimented with using **light, darkness, triggers, and sight-lines** to guide the player ‚Äî and wrapped it all in a subtle **‚Äúhaunted-Unreal-project‚Äù** narrative.

## üéÆ Tone & Story

> *You boot up what‚Äôs supposed to be a simple student block-out file‚Ä¶ but something‚Äôs wrong.  
>  The editor warns you the level wasn‚Äôt meant to ship.  
>  Geometry hangs overhead like a mirrored echo of the space you walk through.  
>  Beyond each pool of light there‚Äôs only an infinite black void.  
>  As you move forward, unseen triggers bring cold lights to life one by one, and distant sounds hint that you‚Äôre not alone inside the build.  
>  It feels less like testing a dungeon and more like discovering found-footage from a project that should have stayed hidden on a hard-drive.*

This tone drove the layout decisions: sparse lighting, pitch-black negative space, broken mirrored chunks overhead, and audio/lighting cues that push the player to explore deeper.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Goals
- Demonstrate **spatial composition** using only primitive meshes.
- **Guide the player** using contrast between light & darkness, rather than combat or heavy props.
- Use **trigger boxes** to:
  - switch lights on/off as the player moves,
  - fire off ambient sounds,
  - reveal/close routes at key sight-lines.
- Implement at least one **collectible** to pull the player through the space.
- Block-out **custom materials** (floor / walls / ceiling) to clarify navigation.
