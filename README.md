# Dungeon Blockout â€” Intro to Level Design (A02)

This repository contains my second project for **Intro to Level Design (Fall 2025)**:  
a **block-out-only dungeon level** built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
The focus was on **spatial composition, gameplay flow, and ambience** rather than art polish.

Features implemented to meet the brief:
- Paper/Google-image dungeon map and room-by-room breakdown
- Gray-boxed 3D layout built from custom primitive meshes
- Trigger boxes for doors, collectibles, and interactive lights
- Simple materials for floors, walls, and ceilings
- A video walkthrough and annotated screenshots for submission
